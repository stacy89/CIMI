				    <p class="card-text">I had a dream for empowering women through exercise and encouraging young women to stay in school to achieve their dreams.  I came to live in the US as a young woman going back to visit my country and reconnect with my family yearly.  On my March 2012 trip to Nicaragua, I saw girls as young as 10 years old on the street corners and at traffic stops cleaning car windows in hopes of getting some money. These girls are not attending school because they are trying to make money to support their family. I empathize with them because I too, started working at the age of 7, going door-to-door and selling oranges and vegetables. My motivation at that time was to buy books to go to school because I wanted a better life for myself. I am blessed because I got that; now I want to give something back so CIMI was born. I want to show those girls that there is a better future if they go to school. And because every young girl's first role model is their mother, I also want to show older ladies that they can improve their outlook and quality of life and their health by exercising through running, walking or dancing.  Running has been a motivation for me, and a huge influence in my life.  I am pleased to be the Race Director for the Carrera International de la Mujer in Nicaragua.</p>

		<h1>CODE_DESIGN_BUILD AT <br> COMPUTER HISTORY MUSEUM</h1>

		<p>On Summer 2017 CIMI stablished a partnership participation with to the Computer History Museum for a day of Boot Camp on Design_Code_Build. Our goal is to expose underprivileged demographic of San Jose Girls to technology and provide them with an opportunity to excel.  we've funded travel expenses, and with the help of the volunteers and Chaperones our first program was 100% successful.</p>

		<p>I traveled with the 18 Girls. 67% of the Girls were from aCE Inspire Middle School and the 33% for other middle school.  All these Middle school are 100% Spanish communities. 100% are Latino students and 94% are eligible for Free or Reduced Lunch Program.</p> 

		<p>Before Design_Code_Build boot camp, I asked the Girls how comfortable they felt about computers.  Almost all the girls knew how important Technology is for their future.  But only 2/18 girls have a computer at home, and they only use computer at school for about 1 or 2 hours for homework or other projects.</p>

		<p>After the Design_Code_Build boot camp, 99.9% of the Girls said the two things they got out the boot camp was, learning how to code and working together in a project presentation.   I said we accomplished our goal.  We are very encouraged to continue with this program to the next level.  I also asked the Girls if they would like to continue to learn how to Code, 16 of 18 girls said “YES”</p> 

		<h4>Here are some answers they give me, when I asked them to mention two things they learned on the Camp:</h4>

		<p>“I learned a whole lot of stuff today. From Learning how to Code to learning how music was first becoming digital…”</p>

		<p>“2 things I liked about the trip is how we used the raspberry app and made commands. I also like the loops in the commands it was hilarious and fun”</p>

		<p>“Something liked about his trip was the raspberry Pie. I liked because we got to see how coding works.”</p>

		<p>“2 things I like about this trip is the A-mazing activity and the raspberry Pie activity because we got to learn about Code programming and how make songs with code”.</p>

		<p>“I really love how with just a few buttons you can make a computer make music”</p>


		<p>“2 things I liked about the trip is that I learned about car crashes and Coding it was fun and I learned a lot”</p>


		<p>“I liked the part that we had to put together a computer”</p>

		<p>“2 things I liked about his trip was that I learned how to do a raspberry product on a computer.   Another thing I liked was that we learned about the old computer back then”</p>
